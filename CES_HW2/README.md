# Interactive Device: Interactive Photobooth
Homework from Creative Embedded Systems, Spring 2021

This repository contains the code to set up a interactive art installation that can be used to control and create projections to be projected onto performing artists or photo and video shoots.

# Materials
- Raspberry Pi (I used a Raspberry Pi 4, but other models may work.)
- Power supply for Raspberry Pi
- ESP32 wrover dev kit
- Breadboard and wires
- Projector and HDMI cord
- Analog Joystick
- 2 push buttons
- SDST switch

# Visualization
The visualization for this project is a Processing sketch. It can be run on the Raspberry Pi to start the interactive device. 

# Configuration
Make sure that HW2_ESP.ino is loaded onto the ESP, and that the input sensors and various components are connected as shown in the images in the setup folder. You may need to press and hold reset on the ESP32 to start serial communication.
